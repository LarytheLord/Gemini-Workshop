When you install Node.js, it also installs npm (Node Package Manager). But the first time you try using npm in the terminal, some common errors can occur depending on your system setup. Here are the likely ones:


1. Command Not Found

Error:

npm: command not found

Cause: Node.js/npm was not added to your system PATH environment variable.

Fix:

On Windows: Make sure you selected "Add to PATH" during Node.js installation, or manually add the Node.js installation folder (C:\Program Files\nodejs\) to PATH.

On Linux/Mac: Reinstall via package managers like nvm, brew, or add /usr/local/bin (or the installed location) to PATH.

2. Permission Errors

Error:

EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'

Cause: Trying to install global packages without proper permissions.

Fix:

Avoid using sudo npm install -g ... repeatedly.

Use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage Node installations locally for your user.

Or change npm’s default directory:

mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.npm-global/bin"

3. SSL / Network Errors

Error:

npm ERR! network request to https://registry.npmjs.org/ failed

Cause: No internet, proxy issues, or corporate firewall blocking registry.

Fix:

Check connection.

Configure proxy:

npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080

If SSL problems:

npm config set strict-ssl false

4. npm Version Mismatch / Corruption

Error:

npm ERR! Cannot read property '...' of undefined

Cause: Old npm version bundled with Node.js, or broken install.

Fix:
Update npm:

npm install -g npm



---

5. Cache Errors

Error:

npm ERR! cb() never called!

Cause: Corrupted npm cache.

Fix:

npm cache clean --force



---

✅ In short: The first errors you’re most likely to face after fresh installation are PATH issues (command not found) and permission errors when installing global packages.

Do you want me to also give you the exact steps to test if your npm is working correctly after installing Node, so you can confirm your setup?
