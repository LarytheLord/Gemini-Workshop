# Workshop Prompts

## A) Flashcards (JSON)
Turn the following notes into exactly 10 flashcards as a JSON array of objects with keys:
- "q": question
- "a": answer (1–3 sentences)
Cover diverse concepts with no duplicates.

## B) Issue Triage (Markdown)
Given GitHub issues (title + body), cluster into 3–6 themes. For each theme give:
- short name, one-sentence description, three suggested next actions.

## C) Code Coach (Tests + Refactor)
Given a small JS function, produce unit tests and suggest two refactors with a 2–3 line rationale each.
